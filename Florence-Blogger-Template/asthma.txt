ASTHMA
What is asthma?

ASTHMA = RESPIRATORY ILLNESS

Swelling in the lungs which led to the lack of weakness and low energy level even weakens the immunity level of the human body is known as asthma.
This is one of the most dangerous diseases with no cure treatment (according to the doctors, if someone is suffering from asthma then it is tough to recover it, they advise what medical science teaches them).
If you ever notice doctors said that asthma is the disease that a person will have to carry it for his/her lifetime along with treatment. The treatment will only give relief but can’t cure it permanently. 
How it affects on the body?
Our oxidative nature follows a path that starts from our nose to alveoli in the lungs. 
Alveoli is the minor part of lungs in which air entrapped and here the first step of asthma comes:
•	The lungs start swelling and alveoli unable to trap air for sufficient time as compared to normal human lungs
•	It starts reducing the body energy level
•	Immunity system weakens and if immunity level drops the body feel difficult to fight against any disease
•	Asthma only affect lungs as the major affected area 
SYMPTOMS
•	Breathing shortness
•	Very low energy level 
•	Chest tightness or pain
•	Coughing or cold flu that caused by breathing shortness
•	Rarely pain in ribs
CAN ASTHMA GO AWAY FOREVER?
Yes, it can go away with proper treatment and effective exercises. 
NATURAL PROTECTION OF LUNGS 
Epithelial lining fluids (ELF) is the first protective phenomenon. All the cells from nose to lungs are covered with the thick layer of (Mucus). This ELF has cilia in it which can throw out all bacteria and viruses from the body. This mucus has a thick line in which antioxidants are present that led to diffuse all pollutants and harmful gases that we inhale.

Vitamin C, Vitamin E, Glutathione (antioxidants) present in mucus helps a lot in the protection of lungs.
Proper consumption of fruits like oranges, kiwi, avocado, grapes, papaya, etc.. fruits gives enough nutrition and vitamins, minerals.
CURE OF ASTHMA ACCORDING TO MEDICAL STUDIES

Initially doctors check your heartbeats from the stethoscope and then they find out that, is patients have a cough, cold flu, chest pain, and shortness inbreathe. After they’ll suggest you 14 days of treatment for trial whether the medicine is helpful or not and will give you some medicine and inhaler. 



Theophylline is the medicine (it helps to expand air pipe).
The same treatment goes for long because this is the only way that relief but will not cure permanently. 
If the condition of the patient becomes worst, then after they will suggest you for Pulmonary function test which helps to know how much percent of lungs are working and how much is not.
